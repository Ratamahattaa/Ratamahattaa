 <h4> A few words about my projects: </h4>

- I turned my passion for artificial intelligence algorithms into a swarm algorithm.
🐜 The program simulates the behavior of ants and their way of looking for a way to the cell, which is generated randomly. [Swarm alghoritm](https://github.com/Ratamahattaa/SwarmAlgorithm)

- In one of my favorite installments of the Call of Duty game series, I came across a mission to decrypt a message. I liked the mechanics so much that I wrote a program based on the one in the game that encrypts the message based on pseudo-random numbers.
💾 Message encryption based on text files. [Coded message](https://github.com/Ratamahattaa/CodedMessage)

- As part of learning to operate on json files, I wrote a program that manages a database of daily tasks.
📋 As part of managing facilities, we can edit them along with deadlines, add new tasks and delete existing tasks. [Task library](https://github.com/Ratamahattaa/Task-library)

- 🌿 My colleague and I have developed a web app that helps busy professionals take care of their plants. 🌱 The app monitors plant health and provides essential data to help your plants thrive, all through a clear and user-friendly interface.
